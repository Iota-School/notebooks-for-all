# User testing outreach email templates

Subject line: Paid Notebook Accessibility Feedback Session

## Version 2

Hi {{name}},

I’m {{sender}}, and I’m reaching out on behalf of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Project Jupyter community. We’d like to invite you to join us as a paid participant in our upcoming user tests to learn more about Jupyter notebooks and their accessibility needs in {{month}}. We got your contact information from {{referral}}.

Our team has been working on improving the inclusivity of our large collection of notebooks and the notebooks Space Telescope scientists will be making in the future. One of our main goals is to evaluate how easy it is to navigate and understand our public non-editable notebooks, and we want your feedback. During the one-hour feedback sessions we’d be asking you to complete some tasks while navigating a preset notebook. We can offer $100 per hour-long session. If you are interested, let me know and I will follow up with scheduling information.

Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. If you are interested in joining us and can’t make that timeline, please let me know. We are planning multiple rounds of user testing and may be able to schedule one that works for you.

Best, 
{{sender}}
