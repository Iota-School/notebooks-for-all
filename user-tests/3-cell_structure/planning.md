# Cell Structure Exploration in Rendered Notebooks

**This set of tests has not been run.** Because the team spent time discussing the logistics of this potential test, we are collecting the notes here so the work remains public.

## Things needed

- [ ] STScI Notebook(s) (at least one, maybe three)
- [ ] Hosted HTML rendered notebooks with the different cell structures mentioned in [the April meeting notes](../../notes/2023-04-25.md) (list, feed, table, treegrid, grid)
- [ ] List of tasks to complete per notebook
- [ ] Script and feedback format
- [ ] Logistic and payment paperwork

## Example of script structure

- [ ] Task 1: Open notebook
    - [ ] I could open the notebook
    - [ ] I could not open the notebook
    - [ ] Something else (please describe)

- How did you know when you made it to the notebook? 
- What controls did you use? (ie. mouse, keyboard shortcut, dictation)

- [ ] Task 2: Find and read the Introduction. Who is the author of this notebook?
    - [ ] I could find the Introduction. The author is:
    - [ ] I could not find the Introdcution
    - [ ] Something else (please describe)

- What controls did you use? (ie. mouse, keyboard shortcut, dictation)

- [ ] Task 3: Reflect on how the notebooks worked for you

- Did you prefer notebook 1 or 2? Why?
- How do wish cell navigation worked in these notebooks? What would be the ideal steps for you?
- What was your favorite thing that happened in this session?
- What was your least favorite thing that happened in this session? 

## Other test logistics

- This is meant to be run as a asynchronous test where we send a list of tasks for participants to complete in an hour on their own.
- How do we want to compare cell structures? 
    - Because we have a small sample with very different means of traversing notebooks, a traditional A/B test where only you split the sample between two different experiences seems unfeasible.
    - Could each participant complete the same tasks in two versions of the same notebook then compare?
    - Could each participant complete the same tasks in two notebooks with two different cell structures?
    - Could each particpant complete the same tasks in the two notebooks made my reshuffling the cells from the same notebook with different cell structures? This could help remove familiarity of completing the tasks in the same notebook a second time.
- We can account for the factors of self-reported feedback by providing options for participants to choose from then add to rather than asking all open questions like we do synchronously.
