# Astronomy Notebooks for All

In 2022-2023, [Space Telscope Science Institute ](https://www.stsci.edu/ will take steps to make scientific outputs, and especially Jupyter notebooks, more accessible for people with disabilities. STScI intends to accomplish this objective by implementing accessibility enhancements to published outputs of Jupyter notebooks used at STScI, contributing these improvements upstream to Project Jupyter where possible, and organizing educational events and workshops to raise awareness of accessibility in STEM. STScI will also directly involve affected communities by working in public and collaborating with community members through discussion and accessibility testing.

## Collaborators

As part of this initiative, STScI will collaborate with STEM- and accessibility-focused organizations such as [Quansight Labs](https://www.quansight.com/labs) and [Iota School](https://iotaschool.com/).
