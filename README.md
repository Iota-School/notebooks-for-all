```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to a11y Untitled.ipynb           # flexible table navigation
jupyter nbconvert --to a11y-table Untitled.ipynb     # a11y is an alias for a11y-table
jupyter nbconvert --to a11y-landmark Untitled.ipynb  # cells are section landmarks
jupyter nbconvert --to a11y-list Untitled.ipynb      # cells are list items
```

```python
from nbconvert_a11y.exporter import A11y, Table, Section, List
```

## History

the `nbconvert-a11y` project is forked from initial development in the [`notebook-for-all`]() repository. 
this collaboration between [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu/), [Iota School](https://iotaschool.com/) and [Quansight Labs](https://www.quansight.com/labs)
brought input from blind and visual impaired notebook users as to what their most assistive experiences could be.
