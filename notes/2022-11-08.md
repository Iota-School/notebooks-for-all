# Astronomy Notebooks For All - November 8, 2022 notes

## Agenda

- Development
    - Covered what changes weâ€™d like to try and introduce in the next sets of tests. A main focus is labeling/making cells a findable division at all.
    - There is interest in making cells sections and tacking that on to the the next test as a secondary notebook.
- No event updates!
- Blog post
    - Patrick would like to draft a blog post (or something similar) for a Space Telescope channel explaining the problems we are trying to solve.
- User testing update
    - [PR for test 1: navigation results](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/pull/26) is ready for review! 
    - Ready for test 2 script, but we need a test notebook to turn some of the goals into a script.
