# Astronomy Notebooks For All - April 25, 2023 notes

## Updates

- Isabela
    - Test 2 results up for review at [Iota-School/notebooks-for-all #56](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/pull/56)
    - [Test 2 issues](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22test+2%3A+content%22) in progress. Several are done. Like three more in progress.
    - Test 3 outline has been started, but we think with the timeline this will not happen in this round. Isabela is to add the notes to the repo so we have it in a safe place for possible future work.
- Tony
    - Rough drafts for main learnings from this project. This is more technical documentation, almost a specification.
- Patrick
    - Attended Jupytercon! Presented!
    - Conversations there may influence future work. [NumFocus small development grant work](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants) is possible? Quansight Labs’ [community work order](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/community-opensource-funded-development) process?
- Jenn
    - Attended Jupytercon! Presented as a poster and a talk!
    - Budget review: we’re on track!

## Write up and sharing work

- We had a longer discussion about what needed to be written and where things should go. Jenn is going to match the two so we can move forward.
- We will let each other know when actions are being taken and get review.
