# Astronomy Notebooks For All - July 19, 2022 notes

## Agenda

- The [Inclusive Components book](https://inclusive-components.design/) was found in the wild offices of STScI! 
- Event planning update (moved from last month)
  - This is not high-priority at the moment because we need to spend time to get the other areas up and running.
  - The only thing we may want to put first is getting a location reserved because it is difficult to do last-minute.
- User testing update
  - Jenn is trying to figure out how to pay participants
       - HR blockers and mystery timelines are a concern.
       - Is this a blocker for scheduling testers, or do we want to schedule while this is still in flux?
       - Conclusion: we are looking for a timeline for payment to tell testers before outreach. We need to get a sense for the situation so we can plan accordingly. 
       - Do testers need to sign any forms (consent forms, payment forms)?
  - Thanks to Erik for [the notebook](https://eteq.github.io/notebooks-for-all/14jun22_stsci_example_notebook.html)!
  - Recruiting timeline?
    - We have a list of people to outreach too and a template with the beginning info they need.
    - This will be temporarily blocked by the payment timeline questions, but things are ready to deployed when that is unblocked.
  - Finalizing testing script
  - Schedule Practice test with Patrick (post-August 5)
  - Browsers for test
    -  Lack of support for Edge and IE
    -  More support for Firefox and Chrome, but safari can work
    -  Ask ‚Äúwhat is your default browser‚Äù when recruiting to know beforehand and plan accordingly
-  Tony and Patrick report! Technical stuff
   - We met to set up and explore the existing infrastructure we will be working with.
   - Took note of some beginning notebook semantics and mis/alignments. Main, section, article HTML semantics.
   - Future conversation: semantics to use
   - Adding static, automated accessibility tests is something needed, but currently nontrivial. This will help us measure changes and help with reporting.
      - What do we mean by ‚Äútests‚Äù in this case? Automated tests, the user testing, something else?
- Notebooks for all repo
  - Renamed master to main
  - Branch protection
  - Conventions for cells, cell, output section tags
  - How do we want to use this repo? How does it archive our work so we can reproduce this issues and demonstrate the changes?
   - To store notes, to store and render the notebooks we will use for usability tests, to store usability test resources, to hold automated testing and CI, to provide a space for reproducing test results by test round. This is subject for further discussion.

## Work Plan

## Tasks

- Jenn and Isabela: Schedule a practice run with Patrick using a screen reader (when script is complete) (post-August 5)
- Jenn: Test participant payment
- Isabela: Generic test consent form
- Jenn: does HR have a consent form needed for this kind of test/contracting?
- Erik: make a PR for repo organization so we know where people want things (so we stop confusing scripts and scripts and tests and tests üòÜ)
- Isabela: make another pass at editing the user testing script based on testing notebook
- Event date and room reservation by end of August
